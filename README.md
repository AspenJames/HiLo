# HiLo Guessing Game

A simple text number guessing game written in Java.

## Compilation

Compile with `javac src/HiLo.java -d ../bin/`. This generates a class file in
`bin/HiLo.class`, which can be run by changing into the `bin/` directory and
executing `java HiLo`.

## How to play

Run the program with `java HiLo` from within the `HiLo/bin/` directory. You
will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program will output
if your guess was too high, too low, or correct. Upon winning, the program will
output how many tries it took to guess the correct number and prompt the user
to play again or exit.
